### How to Play

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Player 1 uses 'X' and Player 2 uses 'O'.
- Players take turns to place their marks in empty cells.
- The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If all 9 cells are filled and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game is a draw.
